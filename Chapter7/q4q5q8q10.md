### Q4: Why package object syntax?

To centralize the "variable" part of the package, as you would not have various places to define variables. It also solves issues of order in exectution.

### Q5: private[com]

This would limit the scope of giveRaise to the com package and all of its subpackages. It is not very useful as most code is packaged in a com.something package anyway. 

### Q8: import java._ ; import javax._

This puts all the base java packages in scope. So java.net and javax.net as well as javax.lang and java.lang are now directly available. In the REPL, is does not work. So no, it is not a good idea to put everything at such a high level in scope.
